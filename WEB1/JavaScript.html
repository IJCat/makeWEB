        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
          programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
          well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
          environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
          Acrobat. vaScriptJa is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
          single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
          imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read
          more about JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not
          the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments.
          For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs
          and DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language
          Specification(ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API
          specification(ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN
          is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in
          cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already
          been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN
          articles may use some of those new features.
        </p>

          Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both
          "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of
          Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming
          languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.
