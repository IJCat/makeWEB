            The <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">World Wide Web</a> (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified
            by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1]
            English scientist <strong>Berners-Lee</strong> invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer
            program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside of CERN
            in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet
            in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the
            primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents
            formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

            In addition to formatted text, web pages may
            contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent
            pages of multimedia content. Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web
            pages with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content can largely
            be provided by the publisher, or interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon
            the users or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely for
            commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organisational purposes.
