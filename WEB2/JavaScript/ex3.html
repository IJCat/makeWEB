    <p>
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span>(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or
      just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
      While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
      non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and
      Adobe Acrobat. vaScriptJa is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
      single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
      and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section is dedicated to the
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> language itself, and not the parts that
      are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information
      about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standards for <span class="js">JavaScript</span> are the ECMAScript
      Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization
      API specification (ECMA-402). The
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> documentation throughout MDN is based
      on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in cases where
      some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented
      in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of
      those new features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not confuse
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> with the Java programming language.
      Both "Java" and "<span class="js">JavaScript</span>" are trademarks or
      registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However,
      the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and
      use.
